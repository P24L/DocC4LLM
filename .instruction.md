# DocC4LLM - Project Instructions

## Project Overview

DocC4LLM is a fork and extension of the DocCArchive library, designed to export Apple's DocC documentation archives into formats suitable for Large Language Models (LLMs). The project provides tools to convert structured documentation into plain text and markdown formats that can be easily consumed by AI models for training, fine-tuning, or context provision.

## Project Goals

1. **LLM-Optimized Export**: Convert DocC archives into formats that are optimal for LLM consumption
2. **Comprehensive Processing**: Process all documents in DocC archives, including nested subfolders
3. **Multiple Output Formats**: Support both plain text and markdown export formats
4. **CLI Tool**: Provide a command-line interface for easy integration into workflows
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handle unsupported content types and edge cases

## Current State

### What's Been Accomplished

1. **Forked and Renamed**: Successfully forked DocCArchive and renamed it to DocC4LLM
2. **CLI Tool**: Created `docc4llm` command-line tool in `Sources/docc4llm/main.swift`
3. **Export Functions**: Implemented export functionality in `Sources/DocCArchive/Export.swift`:
   - `exportToMarkdown()` - Converts documents to markdown format
   - `exportToPlainText()` - Converts documents to plain text format
4. **Recursive Processing**: Added support for processing all JSON files in DocC archives recursively
5. **Content Type Support**: Extended support for various DocC content types:
   - Links (`LinkInlineContent`)
   - Thematic breaks
   - Custom role headings
   - Tables
   - Various symbol kinds including extensions
6. **Error Handling**: Implemented graceful handling of unsupported content types
7. **Testing**: Added comprehensive test fixtures and test cases
8. **GitHub Integration**: Successfully pushed to GitHub with SSH authentication

### Key Extensions to DocCArchive

1. **Export Functionality**: Added `Export.swift` with markdown and plain text export functions
2. **CLI Interface**: Created `main.swift` for command-line usage
3. **Enhanced Content Processing**: Extended content type support beyond the original library
4. **Recursive Document Processing**: Implemented processing of all documents in archive subfolders
5. **Error Resilience**: Added graceful handling of unsupported content types

### Technical Implementation

- **Language**: Swift
- **Package Manager**: Swift Package Manager
- **CLI Tool**: `docc4llm` command
- **Output Formats**: Markdown and plain text
- **Processing**: Recursive JSON file processing
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for unsupported content

## GitHub Integration

- **Repository**: Successfully pushed to GitHub
- **Authentication**: SSH key-based authentication configured
- **Branch**: Main branch with initial working version
- **Status**: Ready for further development and collaboration

## Future Development Directions

### Immediate Next Steps (Quick Wins)

1. **Configuration Options**: Add configurable export options
   - Which parts of documentation to export (API docs, tutorials, articles)
   - Output format preferences
   - Filtering options (by platform, language, etc.)
   - Custom templates for output formatting

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve the underlying library
   - Better handling of previously error-prone content types
   - More detailed error reporting
   - Recovery mechanisms for corrupted archives

### Major Features

3. **Online DocC Support**: Download and process JSON files from URLs
   - Support for Apple's online documentation
   - URL-based processing
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Incremental updates

4. **Advanced Export Options**:
   - JSON output format for structured data
   - Custom markdown templates
   - Metadata extraction
   - Cross-reference resolution

5. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Parallel processing for large archives
   - Memory-efficient processing
   - Progress reporting for large operations

### Long-term Vision

6. **Integration Ecosystem**:
   - GitHub Actions integration
   - CI/CD pipeline support
   - IDE plugins/extensions
   - API server for web-based processing

7. **Advanced Features**:
   - Documentation versioning support
   - Diff generation between versions
   - Custom content filtering
   - Multi-language support

## Usage Instructions

### Building the Project
```bash
swift build
```

### Running Tests
```bash
swift test
```

### Using the CLI Tool
```bash
swift run docc4llm <path-to-docc-archive>
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Naming Convention**: Use `docc4llm` consistently (not `docc2llm`)
2. **Error Handling**: Always handle unsupported content gracefully
3. **Testing**: Add test fixtures for new content types
4. **Documentation**: Update README.md for new features
5. **Git Workflow**: Use meaningful commit messages and push regularly

## Current Limitations

1. Some complex DocC content types may not be fully supported
2. Limited configuration options
3. No online documentation processing
4. Basic error reporting
5. Single-threaded processing
